# Virtual Stock Simulator
- This repository shows a simple virtual investment simulator with a given dataset.
- Here I used a BTCUSD dataset (sample_data/data_BTCUSD_1.csv), but you can freely set a different one with OHLCV values.

# Try it out
- Open the GUI by typing below, and just play with it.
```
$ python gui.py
```
